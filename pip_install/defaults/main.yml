# If you want to use your own keys for UCA or RDO (instead of ubuntu or
# CentOS defaults), please define user_external_repo_key dict with
# keys/values corresponding to the ansible module arguments for your
# distribution.
#
# For CentOS you'd define the following:
#user_external_repo_key:
#  key: https://my-repo.example.com/signing-key.asc
# You could also use key: <keyid> from a keyserver, see ansible rpm_key doc.
# Validate cert option from the module is also supported.
# In CentOS, refusing to use the RDO package also forces you to add your own
# repository. See below to know how to include your own repository.
#
# For Ubuntu, you'd define the following:
#user_external_repo_key:
#  url: https://my-repo.example.com/signing-key.asc
# This leverages apt_key module, and passes the id, keyserver, and url argument.
# Therefore, you can ensure the id of the key you want to import with id: <keyid>
# or replace the source url with a keyserver.

# If you have defined another set of keys you want to include, the chances are
# high you want to give also your own repository.
# For CentOS, define the following dict+key/values:
#user_external_repo:
#  name: "mymirror"
#  baseurl: "http://mymirrorurl/baseurl/"
#See also gpgcheck, gpgkey, description of the Ansible yum_repository module
# For Ubuntu, define something like the following:
#user_external_repo:
#  repo: "deb http://mymirrorurl/ubuntu/ xenial main"
#  filename: "mymirror"
# If your mirror includes UCA mirroring, you may then want to disable using uca
# by setting in your user variables uca_enable: False
